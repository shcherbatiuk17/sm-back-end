## Usage 
Testing API Routes

We recommend using a tool like Insomnia to test the API routes. Below are the expected behaviors for various actions:
GET Routes:
Access /api/users and /api/thoughts in Insomnia.
The data for these routes will be displayed in a formatted JSON response.
POST, PUT, and DELETE Routes:

Test the following actions in Insomnia:
Creating, updating, and deleting users.
Creating, updating, and deleting thoughts.
You should be able to successfully perform these actions and see the changes reflected in your database.
Reactions and Friends:

Test the following actions in Insomnia:
Creating and deleting reactions to thoughts.
Adding and removing friends to a userâ€™s friend list.
These actions should also work as expected.
